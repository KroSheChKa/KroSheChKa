- 👋 Greetings, I’m @KroSheChKa A.K KroSheChKaShy
- 👀 I’m interested in creating some program to hack the achievements in Steam, farm the time etc.
However, not just to copy SAM Picker, but to make it faster, more optimized, easier to rotate, some new functional 
and soft and comfortable to use design.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning C# and Photoshop
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on some indie games written in C#
- 📫 I'm in for your questions about my projects. You can reach me right here - grooshacannel@gmail.com
